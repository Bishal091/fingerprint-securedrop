Fingerprint SecureDrop Changelog
================================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Fingerprint SecureDrop
release.

Version 1
---------
* Heavy refactor of the crawler focused on composability, testability, and
  extensibility.
* Crawler no longer tries to directly analyze the raw cell log and instead
  collects full, umodified traces.
* First steps of the way towards implementing the schema discussed in
  https://github.com/freedomofpress/FingerprintSecureDrop/issues/16
* More detailed logging including printing traces for all unexpected exceptions
  and saving "debug" traces for exceptions known to crash the crawler and
  one other non-fatal condition we intend to investigate.

Version 1.1
-----------
* Rework directory structure to make "fpsd" into a proper Python package.
* Create the first of a suite of unit tests and a script that will call such
  suite.
