Fingerprint SecureDrop Changelog
================================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Fingerprint SecureDrop
release.

Version 1
---------
* Heavy refactor of the crawler focused on composability, testability, and
  extensibility.
* Crawler no longer tries to directly analyze the raw cell log and instead
  collects full, umodified traces.
* First steps of the way towards implementing the schema discussed in
  https://github.com/freedomofpress/FingerprintSecureDrop/issues/16
* More detailed logging including printing traces for all unexpected exceptions
  and saving "debug" traces for exceptions known to crash the crawler and
  one other non-fatal condition we intend to investigate.

Version 1.1
-----------
* Rework directory structure to make "fpsd" into a proper Python package.
* Create the first of a suite of unit tests and a script that will call such
  suite.

Version 1.2
-----------
* Implement the `self.control_data` object in Crawler. This collects metadata
  about the the OS, tor and TBB version, Python version, IP, ASN, location, SD
  version, configuration settings of the crawler, and the crawler version
  itself. Currently, this is saved as a pickle file inside each "batch" dir, but
  will be entered directly into our PostgresSQL database in the next major
  release.
