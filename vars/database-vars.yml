### Used by the database role. ###

# All of these vars except password will be set as environment variables in
# `/etc/bash.bashrc`. If password is not set, then Ansible will generate one for
# you at provision-time. The password will not be set as an environment
# variable, but is instead saved to a PGPASSFILE, `~{{ ssh_username }}/.pgpass`,
# along with the corresponding information from the other vars according to the
# PGPASSFILE spec.
PGHOST: localhost
PGUSER: fp_user
PGPORT: "5432"
PGDATABASE: fpsd
password: ""
# Note: the database role will not overwrite an existing PGPASSFILE, so in order
# to do so, you'll have to first remove it then re-run the role:
# `ANSIBLE_ARGS="--tags=database vagrant provision"`.
